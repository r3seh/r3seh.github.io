Hello!

My name is Vladimir Nestor and I am ~~an alcoholic~~ a reverse engineer. 
Currently, my fields of interests are malware analysis, obfuscation techniques and means of automation.

This blog is a helper for my everyday routine.
As I collected a lot of snippets of code, tips on malware analysis, I decided to share it. 
Also this blog is a great motivation for me to dig deeper into what I will posting about. 

Hope, this site won't be abandoned and it will keep alive for some time.

My Telegram: @R3seh.
