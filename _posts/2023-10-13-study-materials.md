Geathered some study material to start diving into reverse engineering.
I'm going to keep it up-to-date.

## TechHelp Manual
Convinient cheatsheet for x86. At a first glance can seem to be basic, but for introduction into assembly it's a great meterial.

## Forkbomb
One of the best video course in russian in reverse engineering. 
Good intro into various tools as IDA Pro (hexrays). 
Also it has tasks according to the videos lectures.

## Reverse engineering for beginers

[href](https://files.nazaryev.ru/books/reverse-engineering-for-beginners.pdf)

"Reverse engineering for beginers" written by Dennis Yurichev.
It's a great and comprehensive book.
If you fully read this, you'll be a monster.
It describes how various sturctures like loops, conditions and more, looks like in C. 
It also compares different compilers and options for them and how these compilers translate source code into assembly.

## Practical malware analysis

This book discuss the basic methods of malware pretty well.
Also shows basic techniques to reverse engineering it and how to apply different tools in various cases.
It describes about used api-calls, which is frequetly used by malware, and how to use this information to understand what a function does at a first glance.

## And just video from YouTube
